#Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the caesar cipher algorithm.Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

The program employs the Caesar cipher to either encrypt or decrypt messages based on user input. 
It ensures valid input ('e' for encrypt, 'd' for decrypt) before proceeding to collect the message and shift value. 
The `caesar_cipher` function then shifts each letter by the specified value while preserving case and ignoring non-alphabetic characters. 
The result is displayed to the user, completing the encryption or decryption process.
